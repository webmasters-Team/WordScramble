**How to Use Vite and React**

This app uses Vite to build and bundle the React code. Vite is a fast and modern build tool that can be used to develop and deploy React apps.

To use Vite, simply install it with the following command:

```
npm install vite
```

Once Vite is installed, you can create a new React app with the following command:

```
vite init
```

This will create a new directory for your React app. You can then navigate to the directory and install the dependencies with the following command:

```
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Vite development server with the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

The development server will run on localhost:5173. You can open the app in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:5173.


**Conclusion**

This word scramble app is a simple but fun way to learn how to use Vite + React, utilizing useState and useMemo. You can customize the app to add more features, such as different difficulty levels, different categories of words, and power-ups.
